Word Count guide: 200-300 words <br>

The Agile method is a concept in project management that is aimed at garnering customer satisfaction by adhering to four principle values. The first value of the Agile method focuses on interactions and individuals over tools and process. Teamwork, collabaration, and face –to – face interactions are prioritized in order to ensure architectural requirements are being met and ample support is given to each member of the team. Daily collabaration also keeps indivuduals motivated on the task at hand.  

 

The second value focuses on functioning software over extensive documentation. Continual delivery of functioning software is essentially how progress is managed in the Agile method. Rather than delivering clusters of paperwork and documentation to the customer, functioning software is delivered instead, which has two benefits: It is a tangible result that will put the customers’ mind at ease when inquiring about progress, and it also keeps the software team on track towards delivering a final result.   

 

The third value of the Agile method focuses on customer collabaration. In the Agile method, the customer is placed as the highest priority, and therefore their concerns and demands are always addressed and implemented regardless of whether or not this changes the development/outcome of the project. The customer is allowed to make changes to an original plan and the team must adapt to the customers’ needs.  

 

The last Agile method focuses on being able to respond to change rather than following a concrete plan. This principle is essential in order for the previous value to be effective because adaptation would be impossible if a concrete plan were followed. Customers want to be given the ability to express their needs freely and change their mind on any previous specifications. If the team ignores the customers’ needs in order to churn out a product that was conceptualized months before, the project will no longer be satisfied or the customer may go elsewhere. Anticipating and responding to change also prevents months, if not years from being wasted because a product that is not flexible to change could potentially end up being eliminated.
